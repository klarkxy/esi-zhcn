[technology-description]
tl-basic-tesla-coils-technology=A Tesla coil is an electrical resonant transformer modified to deliver high-current electrical discharges to closeby enemies. It has a relatively low damage output but it can effect multiple targets at once.
tl-advanced-tesla-coils-technology=A significantly improved version of the Tesla coil. Its reach is larger and its damage output is extremely high. It has an extensive steel plating for increased survivability.
tl-tesla-tank-technology=A deadly new tank variant equipped with 2 medium sized Advanced Tesla coil. Single use Portable Tesla coils provide the necessary energy surge to trigger the firing mechanism. This tank takes advantage of the natural volatile nature of electric currents as beam weapons, by employing a special amplification process. The installed coils fire at the same time, but instead of interfering they are synergizing with each other. As a result the created lightning arcs easily bypass most matter damaging anything and everything in its path.

tl-tesla-ammo-upgrade-technology=The advancements of the Portable Tesla coil technology revealed some design deficiencies is the base structure of Tesla coils. Elimination of these design problems yield more efficient Tesla coils with all around improved capabilities. 
tl-tesla-coil-damage-technology=The effective damage done by a Tesla coil's lightning arc can be increased by installing stronger capacitors and introducing a slight oscillation in the currents frequency.
tl-tesla-coil-shooting-speed=Recent improvements made in battery efficiency can be utilized in the Tesla coil designs to be able to reach critical capacity quicker, effectively improving the coil's rate of fire.

tl-flames-explosion-technology=So much energy is channeled through the bolts of the Tesla coil that it can ignite the very air. The the short lived chain reaction takes the form of a violent burst of firey explosion.\n\nEach level of 'Eruption' will increase the explosion's area of effect.\n\nDamage: 60% of turret damage.
tl-flames-count-technology=When dry land and dust particles are ignited due to high levels of electric current the result is a surprisingly violent burning reaction. The flames only last for a few seconds but they generate dangerous levels of heat, burning everything to a crisp.\n\nEach level of 'Flash Fire' will increase the number of flames generated and their damage per second.
tl-flames-probability-technology=Extreme levels of concentrated energy is capable of igniting vegetation on the ground, dust particles or the very air itself. \n\nEach level of 'Combustion' will grant increased chance of igniting the Tesla coil's target and their immediate surroundings.

tl-single-zap-count-technology=When a creature is struck by the Advanced Tesla coil it effectively takes over a large amount od static energy. This energy can cause an overload in the host, violently destroying it. If a portion of the change still remains after the destruction of the host, it will lash out to connect with a nearby resistance. This phenomenon is called a discharge bolt.\n\nEach level of 'Discharge' will increase the number of discharge bolts released when an enemy is killed by the turret.
tl-single-zap-damage-technology=When an electric charge remains after the destruction of the target, it becomes a discharge bolt. This bolt has only a portion of the initial charge's full energy. This energy level however can be amplified by fine tuning the overal resonance level of the Tesla coil.\n\nEach level of 'Heavy Lightning' increase the damage done by discharge bolts.
tl-single-zap-probability-technology=Advanced Tesla colis conduct an unbelivable amount of electric energy. So much so, in fact that if the target cannot contain this level of current - because it expires prematurely in most cases - it will overflow through ionized air molecules in the form of individual lightning arcs, shocking nearby entities.\n\nEach level of 'Overcharge' will increase the probability of additional lightning arcs forming every time an enemy is killed by the Advanced Tesla coil.

tl-multi-zap-range-technology=Higher currents used in the coils increase the number of ionized particles in the surrounding static field. This makes it easier for the charge to pass through air, reaching further targets.\n\nEach level of 'Ionization' will increase the effective range of charge propagation.
tl-multi-zap-damage-technology=Fine tuning the wave length of the emmitted concentrated energy allows formation of more stable - and damaging - lightning arcs when the charge is propagated in the static field.\n\nEach level of 'Lightning' will increase the damage of propagaring charges.
tl-multi-zap-probability-technology=The constant use of the Tesla coil filled its surroundings with ionized particles. These particles allow the chanelled charge to reach past its original target and jump to any nearby object.\n\nEach level of 'Static Field' will increase the chance of charges propagating to every nearby enemy.

tl-slowdown-duration-technology=Highter energy currents deliver more potent effects that linger in the target entity for a longer time.\n\nEach level of 'Persistence' will increase the duration of 'Electroshock' effects.
tl-slowdown-multiplier-technology=Specific energy levels in combination with high frequencies can cause muscle spaams, effectively hindering any kind of movement.\n\nEach level of 'Stun' will increase the power of the 'Electroshock' effects and slowing down movement more.
tl-slowdown-probability-technology=Direct contact with electric currents sometimes have certain physiological and neurological side effects like muscle spasms and paralysis.\n\nHigher levels of 'Electroshock' will make it more likely that these side effects will maifest with each attack.

tl-volatility-modulation-technology=Ionization is a common techniqueto increase effectivenessof electric curent based military applications. When the twin coils are ionized using alternating frequencies a synergy can be observed in the energy pattern. this effect was named bioinization, and it exponentially increase the volatility of the effected current.\n\nEach level of 'Bionization' will lower the potential minimum damage while greatly increase the potential maximum damage.
tl-volatility-probability-technology=The volatile nature of electric currents of the twin coils is maximized with an integrated amplitude adjuster. In effect it means that the generated lightning bolts have enough energy to completely disintegrate all creatures smaller than a medium sized apartment. \n\nEach level of 'Vaporization' will increase the chance of instantly killing the target. Targets having more than 5000 health are seriously injured instead of killed.
