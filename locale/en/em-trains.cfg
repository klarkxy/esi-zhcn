[technology-description]
ei_em-trains=EM Trains are a new class of locomotive powered by a field-based propulsion system, eliminating the need for conventional fuel.\nThis technology enables faster, smoother, and more energy-efficient movement, but comes with a critical dependency: external power delivery.\nTo keep EM Trains operational, you must place [color=orange]Chargers[/color] within range along the rail network. These provide energy wirelessly to passing trains.\nNo chargers, no motion.\nSpeed comes at the cost of infrastructure.\nPlan your grid—or stall in silence.

ei_charger=Charges EM trains in range. Each charge consumes energy. Can be improved by research. Draws 10MW of idle energy. Needs 250W per rail in range.
ei_em-locomotive=EM locomotive. Faster and more efficient than regular locomotives. Requires a working charger in range to operate.
ei_em-cargo-wagon=EM cargo wagon. Has 60 item slots.
ei_em-fluid-wagon=EM fluid wagon. Can transport 50k fluid.
